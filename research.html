<h2>Practical Algorithms for Distributed Quantization and Optimization </h2>
<!--As we enter the age of “big data”, datasets are growing to ever increasing 
sizes and there is an urgent need for scalable machine learning algorithms.
 In Bayesian learning, the central object of interest is the posterior 
 distribution and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been 
 developed for “big data” settings. However, naive algorithms exhibits
  an impractical O(N) computation and so, distributing data onto several nodes becomes a natural choice. These nodes perform 
  local sampling based on their own locally stored 
  data followed by a final post-processing step of combining the samples. 
  Such algorithms require internal communication between the nodes only at the very
   beginning and end of the procedure which are costly, for example due high latency. 
Such problems arise in a variety of applications ranging from compression and Federated
learning. In this thesis, we propose to study practical and 
theoretically optimal algorithms for such problems.-->

This issue is prevalent in FL-based solutions for other related problems, too, such as channel estimation. ."

Usually the mutual-information values for the bit-channels are computed for the construction of the code. Using these available mutual-information values, we identify the information bits exhibiting full polarization and having high channel reliability. In the proposed mutual-information-based SCL (MI-SCL) decoder, only one emanating path is considered for such bits. Simulation results show that the performance of the MI-SCL decoder with a particular value of the list size L is very close to that of the existing SCL decoder with the list size 2L.";
